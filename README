What's Up v0.1
Jack Carrozzo <jack@crepinc.com>

The code currently takes a list of TLEs from a text file
and shows you which of them are above the horizon in your location.

Once that is solid, it will also control a polar device for a camera,
laser, or telescope.

The celestial math is done by PyEphem:

TODO: 
- Add configuration for things like location, timezone
- Allow a directory of TLEs to be passed and parsed
- Write the serial motion control commands and such
- Fix the table formatting (sometimes it gets upset)
