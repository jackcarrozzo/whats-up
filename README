What's Up v0.2
Jack Carrozzo <jack@crepinc.com>

This code is meant to allow you to see what celestial bodies are above 
the horizon, then follow them through the sky with a telescope, camera, 
or laser. Eventually I hope to support nontrivial kinematics and active
control as well.

In its current state, cloning the git repo and running without arguments
will print a list of viewable satellites currently above the horizon in
the location specified in base.conf. While the original code was intended
for sats only, it should be quick to expand the scope to planets and stars
as well.

The celestial math is done by PyEphem:

TLE source: http://www.tle.info/data/

TODO: 
- Write documentation and proper help
- Add configuration for things like location, timezone (in progress)
- Allow a directory of TLEs to be passed and parsed
- Star and Planet support
- Write TLE update script
- Write the serial motion control commands
- Fix the table formatting (sometimes it gets upset)

Future features:
- Nontrivial kinematics (N axis arms, non-polar/non-az-el coords)
- Star finder coord calibration
- Visual tracking
- Unknown object path calc (ie, determine TLE from observed path)
